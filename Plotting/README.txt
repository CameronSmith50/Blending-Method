This is the README file for the plotting of any data generated by the simulations.

The code is written using Python 3.7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select the coupling type by placing a 1 on the appropriate line, and select the example using by typing
a 1 on the appropriate line, according to:
	EX_1 - Uniform initial condition, pure diffusion.
	EX_2 - Step-function initial condition, pure diffusion.
	EX_3 - Morphogen gradient.
	EX_4 - Second-order reaction system.
Finally, run the code and the plots of the system and the relative errors will appear in the "Figures" folder.

Important note
--------- ----
Also note that figures will be overwritten if you run the same coupling and example. Please be careful and ensure that you have saved any figures elsewhere if necessary.
